            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>At this I heard a mighty claſhing of Armor, and a great confuſed noiſe of people howling and groaning; upon which, the Candle before S. <hi>Jerome</hi> burnt blue: and by the laſt light of it he diſſolv'd into a ſhower of Tears, and ſo in a Miſt vaniſh't away. I was now left in the dark, not knowing which way I came in, or how to get out again: and therefore I ſtood my ground, expecting to ſee what would be the event of that great Hurly Burly I heard: at laſt a pair of great Gates opened, and there crowded in a vaſt number of <hi>Turks,</hi> all bloody and wounded, ſtript ſtark naked, ſhivering and groaning, and crying, <hi>How has the</hi> Mufti <hi>deceived us! What a prodigious Impoſtor does our great Prophet</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met <hi>at laſt prove to us! the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing

us victory if we fight, and the ſecond a Paradiſe if we die.</hi>—But what did they promiſe you for <hi>running away?</hi> cry'd a great number of ugly <hi>ſhe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, (with naſty duggs, puſhing them forward with flaming Torches) Had ye not ſuperfine notions of the ſtate after death, think you? Are you not pretty Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for rolling black-ey'd women, when your carcaſſes are nothing but duſt or putrefaction? aſſure your ſelves we are all the Company you are like to keep; and if this be your Paradiſe, you ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were no ſooner diſpos'd of where thoſe implacable Furies thought fit, but I ſaw a great number, as I thought, under a more cruel diſcipline: for they were driven along by an huge and terrible tall Fiend, brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on the backs with red hot <hi>half Moons;</hi> and their faces were all overſmear'd with blood: asking who they were, I was told that they were the <hi>Teckelites,</hi> and that <hi>Lucifer</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken particular care of them, by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from the honeſter <hi>Turks,</hi> by cutting off their foreskins, and had bedaubed their faces with the blood of their <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> in token of their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97029:13"/>
renouncing their Chriſtian <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and to mark them out for the <hi>greater</hi> Damnation.</p>
            <p>I was no ſooner got clear of thoſe numerous wretches, but I eſpied a Gentleman, whom I formerly knew, and who was acquainted with moſt of the affairs of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and had travailed through moſt parts of <hi>Turky;</hi> but before I could accoſt him, there came between us the renowned <hi>Vizier Cuperlee,</hi> raging and fretting with ſo much wrath and fury in his face, that he made all tremble before him.</p>
            <p>However, as ſoon as he was paſt, <hi>Signior Chriſtiano</hi> (for that was my friends name) came to me, and inviting me to follow after him, told me that I ſhould both hear and ſee things worth my Obſervation: and indeed we had not gone a Furlong, before the haughty <hi>Vizier</hi> fell on his knees, and laying his hand on his breaſt, and bowing his head: <hi>O</hi> Mahomet (<hi>cry'd He) our holy and great Prophet, why haſt thou ſuffered ſo much ſhame and diſhonour to hefall the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Forces, that were raiſed to propagate thy Faith and holy Religion, to the ends

of the Earth? Whilſt I govern'd the</hi> Divan, <hi>all things, we undertook, proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both at home and abroad; but now I underſtand that the Banner that bears thy Sacred name, is carried in Triumph to the Idolatrous City.

               <hi>thy true diſciples, flee before the face of</hi> Gaurs <hi>and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers; ſee here the Carcaſſes of thy proſelytes that come from the burning ſands of</hi> Libya, <hi>lye here unburied in this cold Climate, where Rocks of Ice blunt the Sun-beams! Grant we may revenge this loſs, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, upon theſe unwaſhed Chriſtians; that we may flea their Magiſtrates alive; That we may rip up their teeming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and give their Breaſts to Wolves and Dogs; That we may ſend all their Sacred Prieſts to the Plough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not <hi>all</hi> of them, cryed a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who had like to have ſtumbled over him; I know not what wrong we of our Society have done you: You are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to us for that poſture of affairs that gave an advantage of beginning a War, which in all probability might have prov'd very honourable and profitable to the <hi>Sultan:</hi> had our deſigns taken effect in <hi>Poland,</hi> that King had never hindred yours before <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97029:14"/>
Did not <hi>We</hi> divide the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, it were in vain for all the forces of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to attacque the <hi>united</hi> Powers of Chriſtendom: 'tis we have weakened the houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> 'tis we have brought your mortal enemy, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſo low: <hi>and although you will not acknowledge Chriſt; yet I know not what reaſons you have to object againſt</hi> Ignatius Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola, <hi>who was as good a <hi>Souldier</hi> as</hi> Mahomet; <hi>and <hi>We</hi> have ſince been as great Merchants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do not forget,</hi> replyed the Vizier, <hi>how much the</hi> Divan <hi>is beholding to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave; and therefore let this be the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt us: We will carry on the War in the Empire, untill you have gained the Popedom, and when</hi> Vienna <hi>is Ours, and</hi> Rome <hi>Yours, you ſhall help us to deſtroy all the Hereticks of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially the</hi> Perſians; <hi>and</hi> We <hi>will aſſiſt you to deſtroy all thoſe of Yours, particularly the</hi> Engliſh.</p>
            <p>The Bargain was concluded by their friendly parting, but the Jeſuit was not long gone, ere there was a cry, <hi>Make room for the King of</hi> Poland: At this very name, the <hi>Vizier</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for fear; but when he ſaw only a

The moſt irreconcileable enemies that you have in the</hi> World, replied the Earl; <hi>and whom we had utterly deſtroyed, had not our deſigns been unfortunately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: by a ſhort relation of which you will know how much I deſerv'd the Kingdom of</hi> Poland <hi>at your hands.

have afforded of his own: But we the true</hi> Proteſtants <hi>of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>being oppreſt with Popiſh and Idolatrous Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, ſtirred up the minds of the people to contend againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the</hi> Man of ſin: <hi>By which means we raiſed ſo many Tumults and Seditions, that he had not only enough to do to keep his own Subjects in Peace, but indeed it was a wonder that</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd his own life. <hi>However, We made it uncomfortable enough to him: For though the Occaſions were never ſo preſſing and urgent: Though the Honour and ſafety of the Nation depended ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much upon it, we would not grant him a Penny; nay, we would not let him</hi> borrow <hi>an Aſper of any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97029:16"/>
but when it was taken, to the eternal ſhame of the Citizens, there was enough found, not only to ſupply the Luxury, but the Covetouſneſs of the</hi> Turks. <hi>I ſee now you are our friends, and therefore let us make a League; an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation be pleas'd to call it,</hi> ſaid the Earl, <hi>and let it be to deſtroy Popery and Popiſh Succeſſors.</hi> Withall my heart replyed the Vizier, <hi>I'le down with their Images, I'le burn their Wooden gods, untill the ſap runs out at their Heels; we'll perſecute their <hi>Crucified</hi>
               </hi> God from City to City. <hi>Oh! ay, ay,</hi> cry'd the Earl, <hi>Now you have hit upon't, be ſure utterly to aboliſh the</hi> Sign <hi>of the</hi> Croſs, <hi>and you will gain the Hearts of all true Proteſtants for ever.

How ſo,</hi> replyed the Earl? <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid the Vizier, <hi>you know that one Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>hath polluted your Chriſtian account or Kalendar, by the alteration of ten days; for the future therefore let all true Proteſtants date all affairs, from the Year of</hi> Hegira. <hi>All the reaſon in the world,</hi> ſaid the Earl; <hi>for I'll tell
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97029:16"/>
you what a Sorcerous trick a damn'd Popiſh Almanack maker ſerved you. What was that,</hi> ſaid the Vizier? <hi>You know,</hi> replyed the Earl, <hi>that the ninth day of</hi> September, <hi>the Chriſtian Army came to the Relief of</hi> Vienna, <hi>that on the tenth they were clearly Maſters of your Camp, and routed your forces. Too true,</hi> ſaid the Vizier. <hi>What then? why, in an Almanack which a Gentleman bought at</hi> Florence <hi>in</hi> Italy, <hi>printed for the year 1683, for the</hi> 20th <hi>day of</hi> September, <hi>which with us is the</hi> 10th, <hi>was this prediction:</hi> il gladio di Dio in viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra di Imperio Ottomanno, principi Chriſtiani molto felici, <hi>&amp;c. No more of the Language of the beaſt.</hi> In Engliſh, thus: That the Sword of God ſhould be in the bowels of the Ottoman Empire, that the Chriſtians ſhould be very happy, <hi>&amp;c. How wonderfully,</hi> replied the Vizier, <hi>did all your Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticators fib that year when they ſo confidently affirm'd that we ſhould pull down the Pope, and overturn the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Crown. Don't deſpair,</hi> ſaid the Earl, <hi>you have the prayers of the Brethren: Do but once again clap your</hi> Horſe-tail <hi>to the Beaſt in the Revelation, and I'll warrant you, ſhe will run away with

the</hi> Whore <hi>of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and give her ſuch a damnable fall as ſhe never yet had. I perceive,</hi> replyed the Vizier, <hi>you are not very faithful to any body; you do but make ſport with our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but I am ſure we have reaſon to be ſorrowful in good earneſt. Oh! that Fatal day, that Black and Gloomy day.</hi>

            <p>The Earl ſeeing him in a great fit of grief, turn'd to his Chaplain, a little diminutive <hi>Puritan,</hi> that ſtood at his back in <hi>Querpo. Comfort him up, thou man of God; Comfort him up,</hi> ſaid He, <hi>with ſome portion of Scripture, leſt he faint away.</hi>——At this, Mr. Prick Ears opened his mouth, and began to utter, <hi>How are the Mighty fallen!

            <p>The Vizier ſeem'd very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for he went away ſmiling; and beſides, a meſſenger told him that his <hi>Succeſſor</hi> the Grand Vizier, who was ſo unſucceſsfull in the laſt Campaign, was ſtrangled by the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries, at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> Which gave him great content.

               <hi>Laws of our Founder, to</hi> promote the glory of our Order, though with the Ruine of Chriſtendom; <hi>but we muſt not do it, by making all the world</hi> Turky: <hi>therefore our Brethren the</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians <hi>and</hi> Independents <hi>were too too Zealous, to wiſh the ſucceſs of their Arms before that City; they puſh on all their buſineſs with too much violence, and lay themſelves too open to the World: and this is the reaſon that all their deſigns miſcarry. What a yelping and bawling did they keep, when they purſued us from one hole to another, when as they might, to their own knowledge, have taken us napping in their own Conventicles? but they, to gain their ends, by running us down before the people, have ſo overſhot themſelves, that they have</hi> broke their own Necks. <hi>For our part we can ſpare a few men as well as the</hi> Turk, <hi>and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97029:18"/>
don't ſo much value that they over-reacht us, as that they betray'd</hi> themſelves: <hi>the diſcovery of their conſpiracy hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded all our Meaſures for a whole Age; and we may gape as long for a</hi> Fifth-Monarchy, <hi>as the Jews for their</hi> Meſſias<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>if they do not carry things more prudently for the future. Let all things at home therefore be huſht, and forgotten, and 'twill be enough that</hi> the Turks keep the Game a going, though they do not win all. <hi>In the mean time we may ſo play <hi>Ours,</hi> as to eſtabliſh</hi> Chriſts Throne <hi>in due ſeaſon, to the utter confuſion of all</hi> Turkiſh, Popiſh, Arbitrary, Tyrannical Monarchy; <hi>and this is the Buſineſs I am about, and ſo fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>

            <p>As ſoon as he was gone: <hi>And fare</hi> Thee <hi>well, thou pool and Buffoon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Earl. <hi>Do you talk to me of</hi> Eſtabliſhing, Eſtabliſhing, <hi>and of</hi> Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a</hi> Fifth-Monarchy? <hi>you may as well perſwade me to keep the</hi> fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>WE were now ſailing for <hi>England</hi> as faſt as the Winds, and ſwift as our Deſires could carry us, when by the way (methoughts) we found a <hi>Ienizary</hi> floating upon the Seas, and half ſtarv'd, who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make an eſcape in a little Cock-Boat from <hi>Malta,</hi> where he had for ſome time been detained a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

knew him very well: And turning to me, <hi>You cannot imagine</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how much I have been beholden to this poor Fellow all along my Travels in</hi> Turky; <hi>and with what fidelity he hath attended me through ſeveral dangers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of meer</hi> gratitude <hi>I am bound to take care for his Preſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought Sir, (ſaid I) there had been nothing in <hi>Turky</hi> but Tyranny, Perfidiouſneſs and Cruelty to be met withal. <hi>Yes</hi> (replyed he) <hi>there is a certain thing amongſt them called <hi>Good Nature</hi> by us (for none other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage can expreſs it) which influence's ſome of them with that</hi> Candor <hi>and</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, <hi>as will make them ſtand fairer before the Great Tribunal, than the</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous Zeal <hi>of</hi> Treacherous <hi>and</hi> Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Chriſtians. <hi>But for</hi> this, <hi>we are rather beholding to the particular</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions <hi>of</hi> men, <hi>than to the</hi> Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of their</hi> Government, <hi>which in it ſelf is unnaturally Cruel and Barbarous: therefore becauſe ſome may ſay, that I have repreſented the</hi> State <hi>of the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>under the</hi> Turks <hi>to be more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deplorable than really it is; I do confeſs that you may meet with Civilities from ſome</hi> particular perſons <hi>amongst

them; and that they allow the</hi> Graecians <hi>the</hi> free exerciſe of their Religion; <hi>inſomuch, that at</hi> Lariſſa, <hi>the chief City of</hi> Theſſaly, <hi>the Arch-Biſhop (even in the time of the</hi> Grand Seignior's <hi>reſidence there) appears in ſome ſplendor in his Cathedral Church of S.</hi> Achilleus; <hi>and at</hi> Tornovo <hi>a great Town and a</hi> Biſhops See, <hi>not far from thence, there were not long ago, no leſs than Eighteen</hi> Chriſtian Churches, <hi>and but Three</hi> Moſchea's: <hi>But, as I told you before, theſe Churches muſt in time fall to ruine; and the reaſon they are allowed ſo many, is, becauſe they being ſo numerous, might upon great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of oppreſſion revolt, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile themſelves to the</hi> Latine Church <hi>for their Protection. However, they pay dear enough for that Liberty they have: and what do you think of a motion in the</hi> Divan, <hi>of</hi> putting moſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians throughout all their Dominions to death upon any memorable defeat? <hi>Therefore what a miſerable condition are they in, who are like to loſe their</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>if the</hi> Turks prevail, <hi>or their</hi> Lives, <hi>if they be routed?

The</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, waſte <hi>and</hi> barrenneſs <hi>of thoſe Countreys, formerly ſo rich, muſt needs be occaſioned by the</hi> Tyranny <hi>of that</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>wherein the</hi> Peaſants <hi>durſt not ſow what they fear the</hi> Soldiers <hi>would reap: and they have a ſaying,</hi> That were it not for the <hi>Timariots,</hi> there would no Graſs grow where the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi>'s Horſe ſets his foot. <hi>'Tis true, that the very Luxuriant Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of ſome Grounds in ſo vaſt an Empire, produce</hi> Rich Vines, Rice, <hi>with moſt ſorts of</hi> Grain, Cotton, Seſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, &amp;c. <hi>with little Induſtry: but all the</hi> Provinces <hi>are vaſtly altered from that ſtate we read of in Ancient Hiſtories: and on the contrary,</hi> England <hi>as</hi> much for the better, <hi>from what it was in former times: So that thoſe of</hi> England <hi>are very</hi> wicked, <hi>that wiſh the ſucceſs of the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Arms</hi> abroad; <hi>and very</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>or what is worſe, very</hi> ungrateful, <hi>that diſlike their own Government, and mutiny againſt their Prince at</hi> home.</p>
            <p>We were now come as far as <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> where we landed; and the calm and bright Sun-ſhine Day, in the moſt delightſome time of the Spring, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to take a walk to the top of the

            </p>
            <p>Methinks truly, (ſaid I to <hi>Seignior Chriſtiano</hi>) 'tis as Noble a Proſpect as ever I beheld: yet I cannot forget that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from <hi>Scutari</hi> or <hi>Galata;</hi> the Towring <hi>Moſchea's,</hi> with their gilded <hi>Half Moons,</hi> over-topping the <hi>Cyprus</hi> Trees, put me in mind of the <hi>Heſperides</hi> of the Poets with <hi>Golden Fruit.</hi>

               <hi>'Tis our condition</hi> (ſaid the Turk) <hi>to which we were born, and in which we muſt live and die, (and although ſome of our Order, have, like the</hi> Praetorian <hi>Bands of</hi> Rome, <hi>or the</hi> Mammalucs <hi>of</hi> Aegypt <hi>of late years, been ſomewhat too inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent) yet the</hi> Grand Seignior <hi>is Lord of all we have on this ſide the Grave: we eat his Bread, and drink his Water, and breathe his Air; and therefore we muſt</hi> do <hi>and</hi> ſuffer his will; <hi>we may live as long as we</hi> can, <hi>but we muſt</hi> dye <hi>when</hi> He pleaſe: <hi>we muſt have</hi> Patienza ſin a perder la teſta e poi patienza. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> to the loſs of our heads, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience <hi>after that. <hi>Since the caſe is thus with</hi>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:97029:35"/>At this we went down into the Walks, and on a ſudden fell upon two Perſons that were talking together very earneſtly: we were unwilling to interrupt them; yet kept at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as to overhear them (for they talk't very loud) one of them <hi>ſaying,</hi> well! well! I confeſs, I have pretty well feathered my Neſt, but let the <hi>Kings</hi> affairs go how they will, I will e'en ſecure my ſelf, I will e'en lie and Lowng (<hi>as they call it</hi>) let others ſtickle that have a <hi>great deal to get, and little to loſe;</hi> for my part, I am for Cokeſing of <hi>Mammon,</hi> I'll not hazard my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; truly not I. Indeed, <hi>ſaid the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> things are carried very ſtrangely at Court; I wonder what becomes of all the money; I think they did well to vote that no body <hi>ſhould lend him any upon any Branch of his Revenue.</hi> Of whom do they ſpeak, ſaid the <hi>Turk?</hi> Of the King (<hi>ſaid I</hi>)—And who made that Vote? the <hi>Parliament (ſaid I).</hi> And what is that <hi>replyed He?</hi> The <hi>Great Council of the Nation,</hi> into which, ſome <hi>Seditious perſons</hi> crept in of late years, and promoted ſuch a <hi>Vote.</hi> And who are theſe perſons that talk at <hi>this rate,</hi> ſaid He? Why, <hi>ſaid I,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:97029:35"/>
they have both of them very <hi>good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> under the <hi>King;</hi> how many <hi>Aſpers</hi> a day have they, ſaid He again? <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers!

At this the <hi>Turk</hi> fell into ſuch a rage, that he had like to have run over me, and looking ſternly upon them,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye</hi> ungrateful Dogs! <hi>quoth He, do Ye eat your Maſters Bread, to vomit it up in his face again? were ye in the</hi> Grand Seigniors <hi>Dominions, he would ſcorn to defile the meaneſt</hi> Slave <hi>he has, by being your</hi> Executioner, <hi>but would cram ye both into a hole, until ye either devoured one another for Hunger, or that thoſe</hi> Mouths <hi>(that ſpoke thoſe words) eat up thoſe</hi> Hands <hi>that uſed to feed them.</hi> And then, turning to me, Are theſe, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>Virtue, Honour</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> you lately talkt of?</p>
            <p>You talkt, Sir, (<hi>ſaid I</hi>) of <hi>Patience</hi> too lately, pray have a <hi>little</hi> now: I could rather (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) indure to have my <hi>head</hi> cut off, than my <hi>ears</hi> on to hear what ſuch <hi>ungrateful</hi> men ſay. But perhaps thoſe other two Gentlemen that walk yonder, are of a better mind;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97029:36"/>
they too are hot in diſcourſe, let us hear them. As ſoon as we came near them; What <hi>Juſtice, Tom,</hi> (cry'd one of them) can we expect from thoſe <hi>Tory Lawyers,</hi> now they are got upon the <hi>Bench?</hi> the very name of <hi>Whigg,</hi> is enough to caſt a man in any Suit or Trial that comes before them.—That is an hard caſe (ſaid the <hi>Turk</hi> to me)—And what will become of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion, Jack,</hi> (ſaid the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)? for Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> tells us, That moſt of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are <hi>Popiſhly</hi> inclin'd, and you know <hi>Popery</hi> is <hi>Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> mere <hi>Idolatry</hi>—Poor men, ſaid the <hi>Turk,</hi> I proteſt I pity them—But hark you, <hi>Tom (ſaid he again)</hi> pray lend me 50. <hi>l.</hi> for a Fortnight.—I vow, <hi>Jack (reply'd the other)</hi> thou art a merry fellow, but thou haſt ſuch <hi>ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> tricks with thee; you know how you ſerv'd Mr. <hi>L.

               <hi>never to repay it.</hi> However, I have a Bottle of <hi>Wine</hi> or two, and a <hi>Wench</hi> at your ſervice, but a pox on the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down theſe <hi>Conventicles,</hi> a man cannot get a <hi>wholſom Wench half ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently now as formerly.</hi>——Prithee, <hi>Tom,</hi> don't ſtand fooling, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> let me have ſo much Money, I'll be faithful to you.</p>
            <p>At this the other began to <hi>Curſe</hi> and <hi>Swear</hi> at ſuch a deſperate rate, that the <hi>Turk</hi> jumpt as if he had been fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his wits; and rolling his eyes to and fro, and looking upwards. <hi>Are we,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>poor</hi> Turks, <hi>ſo careful of defiling that</hi> Sacred Name <hi>in a</hi> piece <hi>of</hi> Paper; <hi>and do theſe</hi> Chriſtians <hi>make nothing to blaſpheme it upon ſo</hi> trivial <hi>an</hi> account? <hi>Oh!</hi> Jeſu, <hi>if thou be</hi> God, <hi>as the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſay thou art; as thou by the hands of</hi> Amurath <hi>the Second, didſt revenge the</hi> perfidious <hi>dealing of</hi> Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus <hi>the</hi> Hungarian <hi>King, and puniſh him for his</hi> Perjury; <hi>ſo look upon theſe people that</hi> diſhonour <hi>thy</hi> Name, <hi>and take vengeance on them for their</hi> Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.

endure the <hi>meaneſt ſlavery</hi> of <hi>that place,</hi> than the <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of <hi>this.</hi> So away he went in great haſt and fury; putting me in mind of <hi>Hathny</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who being told that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> renounc't his Baptiſm; proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that He would rather go to <hi>Hell</hi> with the <hi>unbaptiz'd, than to live in Heaven with ſo cruel a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was no ſooner gone, but we fell into the company of a Gentleman that was of the Reformed Church, and born in <hi>Romania.</hi> He had been throughly acquainted with all the <hi>Scruples</hi> and <hi>Controverſies,</hi> which the Rigid and Factious <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sectaries</hi> had raiſed in <hi>Bohemia, Hungaria, Miſia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> and whilſt He was in <hi>England,</hi> had a full account of our <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given him to his full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being withal a Perſon of good Learning, and fine Converſation, we were extremely glad to meet him; but our firſt Reſpects were interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loud talk of two <hi>Clergymen,</hi> one of them ſaying,—<hi>What a noiſe have we had this whole Age about a few inſignificant</hi> Ceremonies? <hi>my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

would be worth</hi> 40 l. per Annum <hi>more, were it not for theſe Ceremonies; 'tis</hi> they <hi>make ſo many</hi> Diſſenters, <hi>they keep people from</hi> coming to Church.

            <p>You are troubled about <hi>Ceremonies (ſaid the other)</hi> and I have as much reaſon to be concerned for the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;</hi> for my part I can get no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,

the Biſhops are the moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial men in the World, and where they take a fancy, think no preferments too much, whilſt others may e'en lick their fingers and ſtarve; I have had a good mind to <hi>Johnſonize,</hi> or <hi>Allſopize</hi> a long time. But now the Plot is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <hi>as you ſay,</hi> I am reſolved to be a ſwinging <hi>Tory,</hi> for the diſſenting Preachers are quite broke.

               </hi> [the People] <hi>askt a King: In that</hi> they <hi>would be their own</hi> Carvers, <hi>and</hi> Chuſers: <hi>That they that were redeem'd from being</hi> ſlaves <hi>in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>ſhould not depend upon the</hi> ſame <hi>Providence for their</hi> ſtation <hi>and</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in</hi> Canaan. <hi>By</hi> thus <hi>asking, they ſeem'd to</hi> chuſe, <hi>before God had</hi> choſen <hi>and moreover,</hi> they <hi>who were prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſay, that</hi> they poſſeſſed the Land

through their own <hi>Righteouſneſs, <hi>might be preſum'd to ſay,</hi>
               </hi> they injoyed that Government by their own <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>And,</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Their ſin conſiſted in that they <hi>Then</hi> askt a King, in that they would not wait Gods</hi> appointed time. <hi>Therefore becauſe they</hi> prepoſterouſly <hi>askt a King, He</hi> gave them one in his wrath: one <hi>that was not</hi> qualified <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the</hi> Prophecy, <hi>nor did He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their</hi> expectation. <hi>But in his</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Servant <hi>David, <hi>He fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it to be his</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97029:45"/>
that ever was executed,</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. v. 9. Her King and her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are among the Gentiles.

The Scepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a Law giver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his feet, until Shiloh come. <hi>For as by the Alterations, Change, and loſs of the</hi> Law, <hi>they were deprived of the right underſtanding thoſe</hi> Types, <hi>which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew the <hi>Manner of his Coming:</hi> So (though the Prophecy held good) by the</hi> loſs <hi>of their</hi> King <hi>in their Captivity, the Changes of their Government; it had as it were a</hi> veil <hi>drawn over it, and became</hi> obſcure <hi>to them, as to the <hi>Time of his Coming.</hi> In ſhort, the giving the</hi> Jews <hi>a</hi> King, <hi>was the greateſt</hi> Bleſſing, <hi>and the</hi> taking <hi>him away, the greatest</hi> Curſe: <hi>the one the Righteous Ordinance of God, the other his juſt Judgment.</hi>

               <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>do they call themſelves!</hi> Mahomet <hi>has not more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the</hi> Hiſtory, <hi>than they the</hi> ſcope <hi>and</hi> deſign <hi>of the</hi> Old Teſtament, <hi>where and when it may ſerve their turn.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe under the</hi> Goſpel <hi>there are particular, and eſpecial</hi> Commands, <hi>for our Obedience to</hi> The King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme; <hi>and conſequently,</hi> for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in that Obedience: <hi>but there was no</hi> prohibition <hi>under the</hi> Law <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively forbidding the</hi> Jews to ask a

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe ſuch</hi> diſobedience <hi>(of which depoſing him, and altering the frame of his Government, is the higheſt) is threatned with a</hi> greater Curſe <hi>and</hi> Puniſhment, <hi>than the Breach of</hi> all, <hi>or</hi> any <hi>of the</hi> Laws <hi>of</hi> Moſes, <hi>even with</hi> Damnation, <hi>in that ſenſe, wherein it is threatned to the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Phariſees, <hi>the ſcrupulous obſervers of ſmall things of that</hi> Law, <hi>whileſt they neglected the greater ones of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

But no ſooner is He come to <hi>Years of Rebellion,</hi> but you ſee him as rampant in <hi>Publick.</hi> He finds fault with <hi>every Ordinance of God and man;</hi> He is for <hi>knocking down of Monarchs, pulling Lawn Sleeves over the ears of Biſhops.

And however our preſent</hi> Magnanimous <hi>and truly</hi> Illuſtrious <hi>King, has by his Conduct and Valour, gain'd himſelf immortal renown: Yet 'tis</hi> better <hi>for the people to</hi> have Peace, than a proſperous War. <hi>And the King of</hi> England <hi>has had as hard a Task (and which has required as much Courage and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97029:52"/>
Prudence) to ſubdue and quell his</hi> Turkiſh Proteſtants <hi>at home, as the King of</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>had, to conquer the</hi> Proteſtant Turks <hi>abroad.</hi> Againſt <hi>which ſort of</hi> true Proteſtants, <hi>the</hi> true Turks <hi>ſhall</hi> ariſe in the Judgment, and ſhall condemn them. <hi>For they make Obedience to their Prince, a point of their Religion; but theſe</hi> make a Duty and a practice of Rebellion. <hi>The very</hi> Indians <hi>ſhall</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the Judgment <hi>with theſe</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Barbarians, <hi>and</hi> ſhall condemn <hi>them.

our great Comfort. And may He, in deſpight of all the Enemies of God, and the King, long continue to ſit thereon, to our laſting peace.

            <p>The Sun was now down, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow dusky, ſo my little <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> took his leave, and <hi>Seign. Chr.</hi> who had been talking all this while with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, came ſmiling to me, and ſaid, <hi>I know</hi> (dear Friend) <hi>that you are a perſon very Curious and Inquiſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature and Reaſons of Human Affairs, and I have now an Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Opportunity of pleaſuring you at the higheſt rate. That Gentleman I now came from is a</hi> Magician, <hi>and He, with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97029:53"/>
two or three more, it ſeems, are to have an</hi> Action <hi>to night, wherein they deſign to raiſe the Ghoſts of all the</hi> late Politicians <hi>that are dead, and to charm the Spirits of thoſe</hi> now living, <hi>from their bodies whilſt aſleep, ſo that you may hear extraordinary Conferences about</hi> Polity <hi>and</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>and may have occaſion of ingaging your ſelf in them, as you ſhall think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The name of a <hi>Magician</hi> did a little ſtartle me at firſt, but the bent of my fancy prevail'd above any ſcruple of Conſcience, being in a Dream, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in honeſt men do thoſe things ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which they would abhor when awake. Indeed, I had no time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with my ſelf, for methoughts <hi>Seign. Chr.</hi> was very earneſt with me, ſaying, <hi>See Yonder! the Gentleman calls us, let us go to him, I know you will be very welcome for my ſake:</hi> [as ſoon as we came to him] I am apt to think (<hi>ſaid he to me</hi>) that you, Sir, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what afraid of Spirits.</p>
            <p>I never ſee him tremble but once in all my life, (<hi>replied Seignior Chr.</hi>) and that was at the ſight of a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Woman, and then indeed, He could neither ſing nor ſay. But,</p>

            </lg>
            <p>I do aſſure you, He neither ſears your <hi>Spirits,</hi> nor yet your <hi>Politicians;</hi> for He is an <hi>Honeſt</hi> Fellow, and though I have known him miſtaken, yet that <hi>Honeſty</hi> of <hi>His,</hi> is better than the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> than the <hi>valour</hi> of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> than the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>learning</hi> of <hi>Hobbs,</hi> or <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> than the <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> or the <hi>piety</hi> of <hi>Baxter.</hi> And therefore I will venture to ſet him upon whole Troops of Raſcally Knaviſh Apparitions, and you will be ſatisfied, that he does not fear <hi>ſuch</hi> Spirits. [<hi>Then turning to me.</hi>] What in the dumps, Friend? Chear up!

            <p>We were now come to <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> that renowned Magazin of <hi>Narratives</hi> and <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> and this was the place of Randeſvouze for theſe famous <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians.</hi>——The Lord knows which way we gat into a Vault, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts as ſoon as we were there, one of the Magicians ſpeaking a ſort of unintelligible gibberiſh, burnt a compoſition of ſtrange Gumms in a Cenſer, which had ſuch an odd ſmell, that a trilling damp ſeiz'd my ſpirits, and in that confuſion, the place was chang'd into a ſtately long <hi>Portico,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſeveral rows of Marble Pillars, upon which their hung a great many Trophies, and Spoils taken by <hi>ſurprize,</hi> or <hi>ſtratagem,</hi> and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Hiſtorical Pictures of Martial exploits <hi>that ſucceeded;</hi> this led us into a Magnificent <hi>Dome,</hi> almoſt as large as the <hi>Pantheon</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>rotunda</hi> (upon Pedeſtals of equal height) ſtood the <hi>Statuas</hi> of Famous Perſons, <hi>who by

Turning on the left hand, we paſſed through a door into a ruinous Court, in which there were ſeveral antick <hi>Statuas</hi> Crowned with <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> as of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianello, Knipperdolling,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>excreſcences</hi> of <hi>Fortune, who in her freaks had taken them from Stalls, and Bulks, to ſet them on Thrones, and then ſuddenly kickt them down again into their Graves.</hi> In a corner of this Court, we entred a narrow and winding paſſage, which led us at laſt into a large Room hung with black, and ſet around with dimm Tapers. I was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with this inchanted place: But much more aſtoniſh't, when at the upper end of it, I ſaw <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> ſitting in a Chair of State, with two skeletons on each hand, attending him, which ſometimes ſeem'd to move; whilſt I was looking on him, there came out from behind the Hangings, an old Fellow in Boots, with a Book in his hand, who made his obeiſance to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and as he preſented it, <hi>He ſaid,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Oliver</hi> took the Book, and after he had read a little of it, He returned him another, Intituled, <hi>Killing no Murder;</hi> telling him that by that Book (<hi>which had made him as fearful as himſelf)</hi> he might ſee how much he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him for <hi>his own.</hi> For thou haſt herein (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) given me more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>under thy hand,</hi> than the <hi>Devil</hi> ever did by <hi>word of mouth.</hi> Nay, thou haſt carried me to the <hi>top</hi> of an <hi>higher Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of <hi>Dominion,</hi> than ever he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet to ſet his Cloven Foot upon, ſince his fall; but the height makes me giddy, and ſubject upon the leaſt touch to drop after him into the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Devil,</hi> who pretends to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of Kingdoms with the <hi>ſame Authority,</hi> thou pretendeſt to <hi>give Rules</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> them, take thee, and thy Book for thy pains.—And then riſing up, and looking on us with a Gaſtly Viſage; What (<hi>ſaid

Why (<hi>reply'd he</hi>) He is only a <hi>Knave</hi> and a <hi>Fool.</hi> Lord, Sir, (<hi>ſaid I</hi>) I think he has got Fitts too; for now he has no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to diſpute and wrangle with, ſee how his hands cuff and fight with one another. What are they <hi>Convulſion fits?</hi>——. No, (ſaid he) they are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97029:66"/>
               <hi>Contradiction fits,</hi> they are the <hi>fits</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> againſt <hi>Baxter.</hi> But let us leave him for a little time, becauſe we ſhall know enough of him by and by.</p>
            <p>We were now following <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and his Antagoniſt to the <hi>High Court of Politicks,</hi> with a great deſire to hear their debates and claims adjuſted, and to know the <hi>manner</hi> of that Court, and <hi>who</hi> preſided in it. Going therefore through a long Cloyſter, we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Hall, at the upper end of which, upon a kind of a Throne ſate <hi>Lucifer,</hi> as I afterwards underſtood; but he was in ſo grave, ſo demure a ſhape, as if He had worn all the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> at once, his Countenance was Phip, and very Judicious to behold, he had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtarch't Band, with great Band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings, a long black Cloak down to his Cloven Foot, which now and then bob'd out, or elſe I had not known or ſuſpected him.—The firſt Cauſe that was brought before him was, a great Controverſie betwixt the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> concerning the Doctrines of <hi>depoſing and killing of Kings.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> claim'd it in <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:97029:66"/>
of <hi>their Society,</hi> ſaying, that they <hi>firſt invented it,</hi> that they <hi>firſt preach't,</hi> and <hi>practiſed it;</hi> that the <hi>Presbyterians ſtole it from them,</hi> and that they could prove it. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> replied, that it was <hi>they</hi> who <hi>firſt preach't it,</hi> that they had more <hi>openly profeſt it,</hi> and proffered to drop Authours with them when ever they pleas'd, if they denied it. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> pleaded again, that though <hi>their Society</hi> indeed was not <hi>very Ancient,</hi> no more than <hi>theirs</hi> was, yet that they had it by <hi>Inheritance,</hi> by <hi>Tradition,</hi> and by <hi>Command</hi> from their holy Fathers the <hi>Popes,</hi> long before the Sect of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had a name, or were in being. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd again very haſtily, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were obſcured (for ſome Centuries) yet they could prove that they were lineally diſcended from the Ancient, and famous <hi>Aërius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this laſt name, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were almoſt quite down in the mouth, for a great many thought that <hi>that Aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was the <hi>Prince of the Air,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that <hi>Lucifer</hi> would be partial to ſo near a relation, and conſequently that they had loſt the day; upon which there was an hideous brawl betwixt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97029:67"/>
               <hi>Goodman, Knox, Buchanan, Gilly,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> at laſt <hi>Lucifer</hi> commanded ſilence, and calling for a Bible ſaid, <hi>Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, is brought to deſolation;</hi> the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial</hi> ſhould unite as <hi>Brethren</hi> in <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and ſo with ſeveral Arguments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to <hi>underſtand</hi> one another <hi>better,</hi> to be <hi>more moderate</hi> for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and not to fall out about <hi>that</hi> of which He himſelf <hi>was the firſt Authour,</hi> that none of them ſhould want their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>laſt</hi> preach't or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed it. That he did not call himſelf the firſt Authour, for <hi>that he was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of the honour of the Thing.</hi> But becauſe they had on both ſides ſuch endleſs <hi>Evidences,</hi> and ſo much <hi>merit,</hi> that he was unwilling to diſoblige <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> and that rather than be on <hi>one</hi> ſide or <hi>other,</hi> he thought it no diſhonour to him for once and away to turn <hi>Crimmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were willing to let the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie fall, becauſe the noiſe of ſuch a thing at <hi>this</hi> time, might be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudicial to <hi>them both;</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> advis'd, that it ſhould rather be diſown'd until a more convenient ſeaſon. So ſilence being made, one
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97029:67"/>
with a caſt Horn of ſome decrepit Devil, ſounded with ſo terrible and ſhrill a noiſe, that it rais'd the Ghoſts of a great many <hi>Politicians</hi> preſently; A Cryer called over their Names; and the firſt of them that came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, was the famous and renowned <hi>Nicolas Machiavel:</hi> He wondred at firſt, what the occaſion of being ſo unexpectedly ſummoned to appear there, was: but being told, that it was the <hi>higheſt Court of Politicks,</hi> and that he was to give an account of <hi>his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> he began to tremble exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſeeing ſo grave and venerable an Aſſembly, imagined they had been <hi>all Saints;</hi> and verily thought <hi>Lucifer</hi> had been <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Patriarchs:</hi> therefore addreſſing himſelf with all ſubmiſſion;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I hope</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Reverend Fathers, that at this Time, and in this Place, I ſhall vindicate my ſelf from thoſe</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt aſperſions, <hi>which the ſubtlety and malice of ſome men have caſt upon my Name and Memory for this whole Age laſt paſt, charging me with three things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That I ſhould</hi> vilifie Monarchy, <hi>and</hi> preſer Democracy <hi>before</hi> it: <hi>To which I anſwer,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">In a Letter to <hi>Zenobius Buon-delmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That if I ſpeak largely
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97029:68"/>
in Commendation of the</hi> latter, <hi>it ought to be conſidered, that I was born, bred, and employed in a</hi> Free City, <hi>which was then under</hi> that <hi>form of</hi> Government; <hi>and if you read my</hi> Hiſtory of Florence, <hi>you will find, that it did owe all its wealth, greatneſs and proſperity to it: what I ſaid of the glorious Atchievements of the Commonwealth of</hi> Rome, <hi>was to ſhew the perfection of that Government in</hi> its kind, <hi>but not to propoſe it by way of Imitation for all other people;</hi> for how can any man pretend to write upon Policy, who deſtroyes the moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of it, which is obedience to all Government? <hi>therefore I proteſt, that the animating of private men, either</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly <hi>or</hi> indirectly, <hi>to diſobey, much leſs to ſhake off any Government, how</hi> Deſpotical <hi>ſo ever, was never in my Thoughts or Writings: and I alwayes did, and ever will declare, that in every</hi> Monarchy, <hi>the</hi> intereſts <hi>of</hi> the King <hi>and</hi> People <hi>are the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this there was a murmuring all over the Court, and <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſeem'd ſomewhat diſpleas'd: upon which, ſome that ſtood by me ſaid, <hi>as we have cheated the world above fourſcore years about this man, and made his memory
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97029:68"/>
ſtink among the</hi> True Proteſtants, <hi>who have at the ſame time an eſteem for</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians <hi>vaſtly more Diabolical; ſo for diverſion, we will ee'n ſham the Devil himſelf for once and away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Silence being made, <hi>Machiavel</hi> went on. <hi>The ſecond thing objected againſt me, is, That</hi> I ſhould encourage Princes to Perjury and Breach of Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: <hi>To which I anſwer, That any man that reads my Book entituled</hi> [The Prince] <hi>with ordinary charity, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that 'tis not my intention therein to recommend the Government of</hi> thoſe <hi>men (there deſcribed) to the world; much leſs, to teach them, to</hi> trample upon good men, <hi>and</hi> all <hi>that is</hi> ſacred and venerable upon earth. <hi>If I have been too punctual in deſcribing</hi> thoſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>and drawn them to the life in all their Lineaments and Colours, I hope mankind will know them the better, to avoid them; my</hi> Treatiſe <hi>being both a</hi> Satyr <hi>againſt and a</hi> true Character <hi>of them. I ſpeak not of</hi> Great <hi>and</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Princes, <hi>ſuch as the</hi> Kings <hi>of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>and</hi> others, <hi>who have the States and Orders of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms with excellent Laws and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to frame and maintain their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97029:69"/>
and who reign over the Hearts, as well as the Perſons of their Subjects: I ſpeak only of thoſe</hi> Vermin <hi>bred out of the Corruption of our own ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths and Cities, or engendred by the ill blaſts that come from</hi> Rome, <hi>as</hi> Olivaretto da Termo, Borgia, <hi>the</hi> Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioni <hi>and the</hi> Bentivoglii.</p>
            <p>At this <hi>Lucifer</hi> grew ſo impatient, that he had certainly broke looſe, if ſome of his Counſellors had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> for a little while; and then <hi>Machiavel</hi> went on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third thing,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>laid to my charge, is, that I have</hi> vilified the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and abuſed the ſacred Orders of the Church of Rome: <hi>To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That 'tis</hi> they <hi>have vilified and abuſed</hi> themſelves; <hi>inſomuch, that if the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>of</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſhould be ſent again into the World, they would take more pains to confute the</hi> Gallimaufry <hi>of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Innovations in</hi> that Church, <hi>than they did to preach down the</hi> Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>of the</hi> Phariſees, <hi>and the</hi> Fables <hi>and</hi> Idolatry <hi>of the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>and would in all probability ſuffer a new Martyrdom in that</hi> City, <hi>under the</hi> Vicar of Chriſt, <hi>for the ſame Doctrine which once animated</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:97029:69"/>
the Tyrants <hi>againſt them. As for</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>this I muſt ſay, That whereas all</hi> other <hi>falſe worſhips even of</hi> Heathens, <hi>have been ſet up by ſome</hi> Politick Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators, <hi>for the</hi> ſupport <hi>and</hi> preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <hi>of Government. This falſe, this ſpurious Religion (brought in upon the ruines of</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>by the</hi> Popes) <hi>hath</hi> deform'd <hi>the</hi> face <hi>of Government in</hi> Europe; <hi>deſtroying all the good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Morality left us by the</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <hi>themſelves; and introduc'd inſtead thereof, Sordid, Cowardly, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npolitick Notions, whereby they have ſubjected mankind, and even great Princes, and States to their Empire, and never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any Orders or Maxims to take place (where they have power) that might make a Nation</hi> Wiſe, Honeſt, Great <hi>or</hi> Wealthy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucifer</hi> burſt out into ſuch a fury, that the fire flew out of his eyes for very wrath, crying, How aborninably am I cheated and abuſed by theſe <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians?</hi> I thought that I had been ſure of as good a <hi>Secretary,</hi> as ever managed the affairs of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and on the contrary, he is for bringing our <hi>whole Myſterie of Iniquity to light.</hi> For my part, I do not know
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97029:70"/>
whom to truſt, or which way to turn my ſelf: Are you my friends? And is this your <hi>Politician,</hi> that has made ſuch a noiſe in the world? How comes this to paſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your</hi> Mighty Darkneſs, (replyed one of the <hi>Jeſuits) it was neceſſary that we ſhould reproach this man to all the world, who had been ſo ſevere upon the</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Rome: <hi>and beſides from his character of</hi> Tyrants <hi>and</hi> Uſurpers, <hi>we took occaſion to render</hi> Juſt Princes <hi>odious to their</hi> People, <hi>as if they obſerved</hi> thoſe Maxims <hi>of</hi> Breach of Oaths <hi>and</hi> Promiſes; <hi>and in the mean time have taught the</hi> people <hi>to</hi> practiſe them <hi>in good earneſt: So that in lieu of this one</hi> Politician, <hi>we can plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you with hundreds much more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to your</hi> Mighty Darkneſs. <hi>In the mean while we will ſtrip him of all his</hi> Infernal Honours <hi>and</hi> Titles <hi>he has ſo long enjoyed; ſo that he ſhall no longer be called</hi> Old Nick <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:97029:70"/>The next that came was <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who ſeem'd infinitely vex'd, that <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avel</hi> had had ſo long an Audience; and therefore with a kind of ſnarling ſcream he told them, <hi>That he thought truly, that he did not only deſerve to be heard</hi> moſt <hi>of all, but</hi> firſt <hi>of all too; conſidering the great ſervice he had done for the</hi> Preſident <hi>of that Honourable Court: For have not I, Sir,</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Lucifer) made men</hi> Libertines <hi>and</hi> Atheiſts, <hi>by my</hi> Principles, Poſitions <hi>and</hi> Concluſions? <hi>and conſequently by that means promoted the fundamental Vices of your Empire,</hi> Faction, Sedition <hi>and</hi> Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.?

               <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſeem'd extraordinary well pleas'd with him; inſomuch, that he was ready to pronounce him <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>all the Politicians;</hi> and the Garland was order'd to be brought for him: but Father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſtepping out, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Plato Redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi> telling him, that old <hi>Hobbs</hi> for all his Boots, had been too nimble for him; and that if he did not make haſte, he would loſe, what of <hi>Right</hi> did belong to him; and what through <hi>their Intereſt,</hi> they might procure for him. He made what haſte he could; but when he came, there was no need of ſpeaking himſelf; for after they had prevail'd with <hi>Lucifer</hi> to ſuſpend his determination, they told him, that they had brought before him a <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> that was as much more deſerving than <hi>Hobbs,</hi> or any <hi>Philoſopher</hi> of them all; as the <hi>practical</hi> part of <hi>Politicks</hi> is above the <hi>ſpeculative.

all to an account, keeping a Sentinel at the door of your heart, ſaying,</hi> Who art thou for? If thou art for Chriſt, give me the Word, thou ſhall freely paſs: If thou art not for Chriſt, and haſt not his Word, <hi>ſtand;</hi> If thou come up one ſtep further, <hi>I'le fire at thee. <hi>Thus if you keep down and ſuppreſs theſe</hi>
               </hi> Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, <hi>this ſelfiſhneſs, this pride, this</hi> contention <hi>will not be found among you; but oh! I am faint, faint, worn out</hi> in the Vineyard of the Lord, <hi>and ſo my Brethren, farewel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could not ſorbear ſmiling at this his ſlie Jargoon, and <hi>Seignior Chr.</hi> turning to me, ſaid, <hi>did you hear? This old Fellow ſayes, He is worn out in the Vineyard of the Lord,</hi> when as he has been <hi>ſowing the Tares of Sedition and Hereſie for above forty Years in the Field of the Church.</hi> He will certainly carry the <hi>Garland;</hi> for both <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Nevil</hi> do deſpair, and ſtand ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring like two <hi>Scotch</hi> Runts, that have all to bedighted the Fair; but let us hear what the <hi>Preſident</hi> is going to ſay.</p>
            <p>At this <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſtood up, and with a Countenance very compos'd, and grave, ſaid; <hi>Gentlemen, we do adjudge,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97029:74"/>
pronounce, and declare this man (whoſe very looks beſpeak him, what his words and actions aloud proclaim him) to be the</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>of all</hi> Politicians, <hi>for theſe following Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Without the</hi> Help <hi>of</hi> his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks <hi>all</hi> ours <hi>had been</hi> inſignificant, <hi>and in</hi> Vain; <hi>that <hi>good old Cauſe,</hi> You va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue your ſelf ſo much upon, had never been</hi> brought to perfection, <hi>had not he</hi> mightily aſſiſted us. <hi>You might as well have attempted to whiſtle the Moon under your Hats, as to have laid the</hi> Head <hi>of the</hi> King <hi>upon the</hi> Block, <hi>under the</hi> Axe <hi>of the</hi> Executioner, <hi>had not he the</hi> Preacher <hi>firſt ſentenc't him from the</hi> Pulpit; <hi>'twas the Magick of</hi> his <hi>voice that raiſed whole Legions of</hi> Reforming <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and preacht them into Rank and File againſt their</hi> Sovereign; <hi>'twas He ſnivel'd the Rabble to the</hi> Devil <hi>in ſuch mighty Shoals, as they crowded the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to</hi> Hell, <hi>for ſeveral years together. This you</hi> Jeſuits <hi>do ſo well know, that you venture</hi> drawing, hanging, <hi>and</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, <hi>for the ſake of</hi> preaching <hi>in</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious <hi>and</hi> Schiſmatical Conventicles <hi>in</hi> his <hi>ſhape, and after</hi> his <hi>way; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ſignifies any other mans Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, either</hi> Hobbs <hi>or</hi> Nevils, <hi>when in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97029:74"/>
competition with</hi> him, <hi>who has</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preacht, outwrit, outdone, out-reform'd you all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He is moſt worthily to be accounted the</hi> chief Politician, <hi>upon the account of that ſingular and unparallelled Spirit of <hi>Contradiction,</hi> which is in him in a</hi> double <hi>portion, and in a</hi> double <hi>ſenſe. And therefore when His</hi> Serene Darkneſs Lucifer <hi>askt me, with what Confidence I could bring</hi> King Charles <hi>before his</hi> own <hi>Bar of</hi> Kings Bench, <hi>when the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry form of the Writ runs</hi> (Coram no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ubicunque) <hi>in</hi> his own name and Authority? <hi>My Anſwer was,</hi> That I brought the <hi>King</hi> before <hi>himſelf,</hi> by the ſame Rule that <hi>Richard is againſt Baxter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>We muſt, and do acknowledge him to be the</hi> moſt extraordinary Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian <hi>in the world, for he has not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi> many thouſands of people, <hi>but he has cheated</hi> himſelf, <hi>more than any body elſe. For,</hi> firſt, <hi>He thinks himſelf</hi> very Humble, <hi>when he is ſo very</hi> proud, <hi>that he is <hi>Proud of his Humility;</hi> a ſort of</hi> pride, <hi>which</hi> Lucifer <hi>never dreamt of.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He thinks himſelf</hi> very meek <hi>and</hi> merciful, <hi>when as he is really</hi> more bloody, <hi>and</hi> cruel <hi>than</hi> any Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97029:75"/>
               <hi>he can either fear, or deſcribe; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his many</hi> ſanguinary <hi>and</hi> virulent <hi>Sermons he has preach't; witneſs his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to one Major</hi> Jenning, <hi>in the late Wars, in a Battle fought in the County of</hi> Salop, <hi>between</hi> Lynſel <hi>and</hi> Longford, <hi>where the Kings Party being unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly routed, the</hi> poor Major <hi>was ſtript al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt naked, and left for dead, but</hi> He <hi>with one Lieutenant</hi> Hurdman, <hi>taking a walk among the wounded and dead Bodies, and obſerving ſome life in the</hi> Major, Hurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>run him through the Body in cold blood,</hi> Baxter <hi>all the while looking on, and taking off with his</hi> own hand <hi>the</hi> Kings <hi>Picture from about his neck, telling him that</hi> He was a Popiſh Rogue, and that was his Cruciſix, <hi>and kept it ſome years after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He thinks him</hi> very wiſe, <hi>fit to direct, rule and govern all mankind, whenas he miſtakes</hi> that <hi>to be the</hi> Spirit of wiſdom <hi>in his</hi> heart, <hi>which is nothing elſe but</hi> the whiſperings <hi>of that Eating and Cancrous</hi> Wolf, <hi>that has poſſeſt the</hi> nape <hi>of his</hi> neck.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>If</hi> He, <hi>whoſe</hi> Faith <hi>is</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>whoſe</hi> Religion <hi>is</hi> Rebellion, <hi>whoſe</hi> Prayers <hi>are</hi> Spells, <hi>whoſe</hi> Piety <hi>is</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, <hi>whoſe</hi> Purity <hi>is the</hi> gall <hi>of</hi> Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97029:75"/>
               <hi>who can</hi> cant <hi>and</hi> recant, <hi>and</hi> cant <hi>again; who can transform himſelf into as many ſhapes as</hi> Lucifer <hi>(who is never more a Devil, than when an Angel of Light,) and like him (who</hi> proud <hi>of his</hi> perfections, <hi>firſt</hi> rebell'd <hi>in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)</hi> Proud <hi>of his</hi> Imaginary graces, <hi>pretend to</hi> rule <hi>and</hi> govern, <hi>and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> rebel <hi>on Earth, be</hi> the greateſt Politician. <hi>Then make room for</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter, <hi>let him come in, and be Crown'd with wreaths of Serpents, and Chaplets of Adders; let his</hi>
               </hi> Triumphant Chariot <hi>be</hi> a Pulpit drawn on the wheels of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> by a Brace of Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing. <hi>Let the</hi> Ancient Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>whom out of</hi> Ignorance <hi>he has vilified; the</hi> Reverend <hi>and</hi> Learned Prelates, <hi>whom out of</hi> Pride <hi>and</hi> Malice, <hi>he has abuſed, belyed and perſecuted; the moſt</hi> Righteous King, <hi>whoſe Murder (I ſpeak my own and his ſenſe) contrary to the light of</hi> all Religion, Laws, Reaſon <hi>and</hi> Conſcience, <hi>He has juſtified,</hi> then denied, <hi>then again and again juſtified: Let them all be bound in Chains to attend his</hi> Infernal <hi>Triumph to</hi> his Saints everlaſting Reſt. <hi>Then make room,</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Phariſees, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, Atheiſts, <hi>and</hi> Politicians, <hi>for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97029:76"/>
the</hi> greateſt Rebel <hi>on Earth, and</hi> next <hi>to him that fell from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the Court aroſe every one, even the two Antagoniſts going away very well ſatisfied. <hi>Seignior Chr.</hi> and I were left alone, and had a fair opportunity to reflect upon what we had heard. The firſt thing that came into my head, was the laſt part of <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s determination, wherein he <hi>compar'd the Motives and Grounds of</hi> Baxter'<hi>s Rebellious Politicks, with</hi> Lucifers. For my part, (<hi>ſaid I</hi>) in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Holy Commonwealth,</hi> He ſeems to deny that Poſition, <hi>That Dominion is founded in Grace;</hi> and proves, that <hi>Godlineſs is not Authority;</hi> And that <hi>the Saints are not the rightful Rulers of the World.</hi> And many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that read that Book would think, that he wrote it with a great deal of Zeal and Piety, for the promotion of Gods glory, and the improvement of all virtues. He condemns both <hi>Trran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Democracy;</hi> ſhews a bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in his proper Colours, peppers the Rabble with whole Vollies of ſtinging Epithetes: is very earneſt for the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>dignity of Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>the World.</hi> He ſeems
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97029:76"/>
not ſo much concern'd for any <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> ſort of Government, as that <hi>we may be ſecured in the <hi>Main;</hi>
               </hi> and yet judges a <hi>Mixt Monarchy</hi> the <hi>beſt:</hi> He layes open the Contrivances of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> expoſes the <hi>Papal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations</hi> over the <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrate; has gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht his Book all over with Quotations from <hi>good Authors,</hi> and confirm'd his Propoſitions with numberleſs authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From Scripture,</hi> (reply'd <hi>Seignior Chriſtiano</hi> ſmiling) <hi>Did you never read, that</hi> Satan is transform'd into an Angel<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 14, 15.</note> of Light? <hi>and therefore 'tis no marvel, if his</hi> Miniſters <hi>alſo be</hi> transform'd as the Miniſters of Righteouſneſs. <hi>And</hi> Vincentius Lirinenſis <hi>tells us,</hi> Nullam eſſe ad fallendum faciliorem viam, quam ut ubi nefarii erroris ſubinduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur fraudulentia, ibi divinorum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum praetendatur Autoritas. <hi>And Biſhop</hi> Davenant (<hi>in his twelfth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd Queſtion) ſayes,</hi> Induant quam velint iſti Magiſtratuum Reformato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let thoſe Reformers of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates mask under what vizor they pleaſe, Religion may be their Plea, but Rebellion is their Practice. <hi>And this is ſo true of Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>that as far
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97029:77"/>
as I can perceive, he will confirm it with his laſt breath: But the Mask he has on, will appear to be that of the</hi> Fool, <hi>as well as of the</hi> Knave: <hi>for whatever he in one place</hi> denyes, <hi>he moſt ſtrictly and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly</hi> maintains <hi>in another; and there is not a more ridiculous Book of</hi> Polity <hi>in the world. He confeſſes indeed, that he did not deſign an Accurate Tract of</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks; <hi>not a diſcovery of an</hi> Utopia, <hi>or</hi> City of the Sun. <hi>And indeed I am apt to believe him; for it rather dropt from the concavities of the</hi> Midſummer Moon. <hi>Had he ſpent his Itch of Scribling in writing his</hi> Wifes Life, <hi>the</hi> Hiſtory of Stew'd Prunes, <hi>or</hi> the Pedigree of his Gib-Cat, <hi>he had done much better, than to have defiled ſo much good Paper with the indigeſted Excrements of his Brain upon ſuch a ſubject: For Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>did not either honeſtly or ſeriouſly enough conſider, that</hi> his whole Pile of Politicks ſtands tottering upon a falſe and rotten foundation: <hi>For he holds, that the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of</hi>
               </hi> England <hi>is in the three Eſtates,</hi> viz. <hi>King, Lords and Commons; that the King has but a Co-ordinate Power, and may be over-ruled by the other two. <hi>This is the</hi>
               </hi> fundamental <hi>Maxim of all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97029:77"/>
without which, he never could have pretended to the framing his</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical <hi>Government (as he calls it) or have made ſuch a Buſtle for his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar godly Friends and Aſſociates; but if this were true (which is utterly falſe) why may it not as well happen, that the</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Lords <hi>ſhould over-rule, and conſequently</hi> exciude <hi>the</hi> Commons? <hi>And then what thanks is</hi> that Houſe <hi>bound to give ſuch a notable</hi> Aphoriſm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger? <hi>The Counſellors in that</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Aſſembly, <hi>are of three ſorts by the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom: Some are by Birth, as the</hi> Barons; <hi>ſome</hi>

But ſuppoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>they might or ſhould do ſo, who ſhould then hinder the</hi> two <hi>that are by</hi> Birth <hi>and</hi> Succeſſion, <hi>from</hi> over-ruling <hi>and</hi> excluding <hi>the</hi> third, <hi>that are by</hi> Election? <hi>But the</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>it ſeems, muſt troop out after the</hi> King, <hi>for fear Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>ſhould ſtumble upon ſuch an horrid piece of non-ſenſe,</hi> as the making two Eſtates become three, by the taking away of one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:97029:78"/>
               <hi>No leſs ridiculous is Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>in this depoſing humour of his: for he does like the</hi> Abbeſs, <hi>who chid the</hi> Nun <hi>for</hi> Fornication, <hi>when ſhe her ſelf</hi> had the Monks Breeches on her head, inſtead of her Veil, at the ſame time. <hi>He pronounces very terribly,</hi> Theſ. 327. <hi>That</hi> it is a moſt impious thing, for Popes to pretend to diſoblige Chriſtians from their Oaths and Fidelity to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, and to encourage their Subjects to rebel and murder them: <hi>But as if it were a</hi> moſt pious <hi>thing in a</hi> Jack Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, <hi>he breathes nothing but perfidious</hi> Covenants, Engagements, Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Seditions <hi>and murdering</hi> Treaſons, <hi>for ſeveral Pages together immediately after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Like a</hi> Fool <hi>as he is to his own</hi> Good Old Cauſe, <hi>he confeſſes,</hi> pag. 461. that God has no where in Scripture told us, whether <hi>England</hi> ſhould be governed by one or two, or an hundred; but that where the King is Supreme, it is the will of God that the people ſhould obey him. <hi>A ſtrange things, that the</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Saint <hi>ſhould want</hi> Scripture <hi>upon ſo material an account, who is uſed to ſquander it away ſo plentifully upon every trivial occaſion. Well! ſince</hi> Scripture
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97029:78"/>
               <hi>(as he ſayes) cannot, nothing more or better can declare</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> to be Supreme, unaccountable to none but God, <hi>than the</hi> fundamental Laws <hi>of this Ancient and Juſt Monarchy. But becauſe Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>who would never be govern'd, has little or no knowledge of the Laws, he ſends his Reader in</hi> p. 458. <hi>to</hi> Bacon <hi>and</hi> Prynn, <hi>who were as</hi> great Hereticks <hi>for</hi> Lawyers, <hi>as he is for a</hi> Divine: <hi>I wiſh that Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>who has deſerv'd to loſe his</hi> Tongue, <hi>as much as</hi> Prynn <hi>did his</hi> Ears, <hi>would take example by him, and lay things ſeriouſly and impartially to his heart, that by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Aphoriſms <hi>of</hi> Humility <hi>and</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>he would grow ſo good a</hi> Politician <hi>indeed, as</hi> at laſt to cheat the Devil. <hi>For 'tis a ſtrange thing, that a man who has taken ſo much pains for the ſalvation of other mens ſouls, ſhould ſo careleſly run on tick for the damnation of his own; If it be true, that</hi> the King is Supream, <hi>and that they</hi> who reſiſt him, <hi>as Mr.</hi> Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>has done,</hi> ſhall receive damnation to themſelves, <hi>and, as Mr.</hi> Prynn <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>

his Schiſm and Separation to this day, he practiſes</hi> thoſe very Rules, <hi>which in the beginning of this Book he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers and declares to be the</hi> Jeſuits Directions <hi>for preſerving</hi> Popery, <hi>and changing</hi> Religion <hi>in this</hi> Nation. <hi>I do not wonder, that the late Colonel</hi> Sidney (<hi>who was ſo great a Crony of Father</hi> Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va'<hi>s, the</hi> General <hi>of the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>at</hi> Rome, <hi>for ſeveral years together) ſhould bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row part of his Speech he left behind him, out of</hi> Baxter'<hi>s</hi> Holy Commonwealth: <hi>for ſayes he,</hi> pag. 377. No Man or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily hath originally more right to govern a Nation than the reſt, till Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Conſent allow it them. Few Princes will plead a Succeſſive Right of Primogeniture from <hi>Noah. And this, without doubt, was the Original of that politick ſtrain in Colonel</hi> Sidney'<hi>s Speech, as the directions of the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>are of Mr.</hi> Baxter's <hi>Politicks and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices: For ſayes</hi> he himſelf, <hi>the</hi> ſumm <hi>of</hi> Campanella'<hi>s</hi> Counſel (<hi>for promoting the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Intereſts in</hi> England) <hi>was in Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>daies,</hi> 1.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97029:79"/>
was in heart a Papiſt, and would bring in Popery: To make the Kingdom Elective: And laſtly, To perſwade the chief Parliament men, to turn <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> into the form of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>

            <p>Pray, Sir, (<hi>ſaid I</hi>) do but hear what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayes for himſelf at the latter end of his Book, <hi>p. 489. If any one</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>can prove that I was guilty of hurt to the Perſon, or deſtruction of the Power of the King, or of changing the Fundamental Conſtitutions of the Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will never gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay him, if he calls me a <hi>moſt perfidious Rebel,</hi> and tell me that I am guilty of far greater ſin than Murder, Whoredome, Drunkenneſs, or ſuch like; or if they can ſolidly confute my <hi>Grounds,</hi> I will thank them, and confeſs my ſin to all the world: but Malicious railings, I take for Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions themſelves, I ſhall not regard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will not rail on Mr.</hi> Baxter (replyed Seignior <hi>Chr.) (for 'tis a difficult thing to nickname Schiſm, Sedition, Murther, and Treaſon) but this I muſt ſay of</hi> his <hi>writings, If they were made</hi> hangings <hi>to his Houſe of Office, as</hi> Olivers Porters <hi>Papers are to his Cell, he might do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the kindneſs of</hi> hiding the one ſide
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97029:80"/>
of them that contradict the other. <hi>for certainly no man living, ever gave himſelf the lie ſo often, or complemented himſelf into ſo many titles of Infamy in one breath, ſince the world began; no man ever took ſo much pains to</hi> juſtifie <hi>himſelf, as</hi> Baxter <hi>has to</hi> expoſe <hi>and</hi> condemn <hi>himſelf. For would you know what ſin he is moſt guilty of, (that is ſo ready to make his Confeſſion) 'tis certainly</hi> that <hi>which he</hi> moſt declaims againſt, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing (<hi>in his moſt ſerious Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon theſe his ſuperfine Politicks</hi>) (ſaies he) <hi>is <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>heart?</hi>
               </hi> When once it grows to an enormous height, it will make men ſwell with ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and think none ſo fit to govern Countries and Nations as they: nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo fit to teach the Church: nor any ſo meet to judge what is good or evil to the Commonwealth. <hi>This he ſaies at the end of</hi> that <hi>Book,</hi> wherein <hi>he dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically preſcribes rules of</hi> Polity <hi>for the</hi> State (<hi>as ſince he has done for the</hi> Church) <hi>in oppoſition to all the rules of Modeſty and Obedience, and contrary to all the Laws of God and man. To conclude for all Mr.</hi> Baxter's <hi>pretences to Gods glory, and the increaſe of Religion; theſe his impracticable whimſies would be ſo far

And it is remarkable, that no people ever expreſt a</hi> greater zeal <hi>to oppoſe the various attacques of a Foreign (Anti-ſpiritual) Power than</hi> theſe Diſſenters: <hi>And could I know any one of them that would ſhrink from his Princes ſervice, when his Royal Perſon and Government are menaced, I would eſteem him not only a</hi> Fool, <hi>but a</hi> Traytor <hi>to boot.</hi>

               </hi> miſcarries, <hi>are Innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, Sir, (ſaid I) they are no <hi>Changlings:</hi> this is an old trick of theirs new vamp'd. For after that they had openly practis'd Rebellion for Twenty years together; after they had preach'd ten thouſand Seditious Sermons, and written above a thouſand Treaſonable Books, out came <hi>one</hi> at laſt, in the year 1660. with this Pompous and Gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title, <hi>A Proteſtation of the Kings Supremacy, made in the name of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Miniſters, and oppos'd to the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Calumniations of the Prelats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Very great indeed,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my ears itch to hear what they therein do proteſt or declare. Firſt of all (as loud as they could bawl</hi>) We hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

(<hi>ſaid they</hi>) the <hi>ſame Authority</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> in all Cauſes and over all Perſons, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical (gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Statute to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and expreſt and declar'd in the Book of <hi>Advertiſements</hi> and <hi>Injunctions,</hi> and in Mr. <hi>Bilſon</hi> againſt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) to be due, in <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ample</hi> manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>limitation</hi> or <hi>qualification</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Succeſſors</hi> for ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will know preſently (ſaid I). <hi>We hold and maintain</hi> (cry'd they again) <hi>that though the Kings of this Realm were</hi> no members of the Church, <hi>but very</hi> Infidels, <hi>yea, and</hi> Perſecutors <hi>of the</hi> Truth, <hi>that yet</hi> thoſe <hi>Churches that ſhall be gathered together within</hi> theſe <hi>Dominions, ought to acknowledge and yield the ſaid Supremacy; and that <hi>the ſame is not tyed to their Faith and Chriſtianity, but to their very Crown, from which no Subject or Subjects have power to ſeparate or disjoyn it.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They don't hold</hi> this <hi>for</hi> ever (ſaid he)<hi>: they hold it, I ſuppoſe, in a</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>ſenſe, as they call it; that is, that</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:97029:84"/>
it ſhould not hold them long. <hi>Well, 'tis no great matter</hi> what <hi>they hold, if the King does but</hi> hold his own; <hi>if he does not, they will have as many</hi> holds <hi>for him, as they had for his Father. The Devil,</hi> they ſay, <hi>is never ſo terrible and miſchievous, as when he appears</hi> laughing: <hi>I don't like this ſanctified way of ſmiling in a mans face, when they have been very near cutting his Throat: Are they the only</hi> True Loyal Proteſtant Friends <hi>the King has? Well,</hi> Baxter <hi>may talk of</hi> Humility (<hi>as long as he pleaſes) and</hi> Bull <hi>of</hi> Chaſtity, <hi>and</hi> Mead <hi>of</hi> Honeſty, <hi>and</hi> Ferguſon <hi>of</hi> Piety, <hi>and</hi> all <hi>of them of their</hi> Friendſhip <hi>and <hi>Loyalty;</hi> I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay,</hi> God keep the King from his <hi>Friends,</hi> and I hope He will keep himſelf from his Enemies.</p>
            <p>We now obſerv'd a Blear-ey'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low talking very earneſtly to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſeem'd very attentive to hear him. Surely, (<hi>ſaid I</hi>) this Fellows ſore eyes and ill looks recommend him for a Politick and Myſterious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogue to the Rabble; let us hear what he ſayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am very glad,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that the</hi> Turks <hi>are beaten; for they were brought in by</hi> Rebels: <hi>By</hi> Rebels (<hi>ſaid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to him) Did not the</hi> Emperour <hi>perſecute and oppreſs them beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Why, what then</hi> (reply'd he) <hi>they ought not to rebel? For example, we ought not to rebel or reſiſt, though the King of</hi> England <hi>ſhould bring in</hi> Tyranny <hi>and</hi> Popery <hi>never ſo much: nay, though he brought in the</hi> Inquiſition <hi>of</hi> Spain: <hi>And nothing</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is more terrible than the</hi> Inquiſition. <hi>Do but look into the Book of</hi> Martyrs, <hi>and there you ſee the Pictures of Men and Women, that were Burn'd, Flead alive, Hang'd, Pull'd limb from limb by Trees and Wild Horſes, that had their Eyes bor'd out, their Hands, Feet and Head cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people ſeem'd mightily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and affected: and I ask'd <hi>Seignior Chriſtiano</hi> what he was, or if he knew him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Know him!</hi> (reply'd he) <hi>I have known him theſe three or four years, to have been the moſt</hi> Factious Stickling Raſcal <hi>in the whole Town, promoting</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>and</hi> Rebellion <hi>with all his might and Intereſt, in all times, and in all places where he comes: his very breath ſtinks, and his teeth are rotten as Devils dung, with talking of</hi> Treaſon. <hi>Do but conſider, with what</hi> artificial <hi>malice he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97029:85"/>
has now conveyed thoſe</hi> unreaſonable Fears <hi>and</hi> Jealouſies <hi>into the Hearts of the people, that will moſt readily and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually frighten them from</hi> that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>he pretends to preach into</hi> thoſe very rebellious practices, <hi>from which he would ſeem to diſſwade them. But this is no</hi> new Policy <hi>of theirs: for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the</hi> late Troubles, <hi>a Book call'd</hi> The Book of Projects, <hi>and addreſt to the King, did him more harm, than the moſt rancorous and railing Libel that ever was ſet forth; and if it was not written with a great deal of</hi> malice, <hi>it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd with a very great deal of</hi> Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. <hi>But yonder is</hi> another <hi>of their</hi> Politicians <hi>at work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſaw a tall black Fellow in a long Cloak, at ſome diſtance, with a Crowd about him, who was howling and bawling at ſuch an horrid rate, that before we came near him, we could perfectly hear him, in a diſmal Tone inveighing againſt <hi>The Whore of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>The Man of sin, Antichriſt, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wickedneſſes, Popery and Idolatry;</hi> pleading heartily for the <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> for a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>thorough Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all the reliques and rags of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Prelatical Superſtition.</hi> I was got
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97029:86"/>
by this time very near him; and as ſoon as he had done, he walk'd off with one of his Audience (who they ſaid was a very rich man, and was lookt upon as a very <hi>rigid Diſſenter:</hi>) (thinking himſelf private enough,) <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſaid the Preacher to him) <hi>The</hi> Cardinal <hi>has given order for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of twenty thouſand Livres; pray take care to get your moneys return'd as ſoon as you can, and</hi> much good may it do you. <hi>But I beſeech you, do not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> our <hi>buſineſs; you know your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; be you ſure to blaze abroad, that</hi> ſuch <hi>and</hi> ſuch <hi>men are</hi> French Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Give</hi> T. N. <hi>twenty or thirty, pounds for writing his laſt Book, for he is poor, but</hi> very true to us: <hi>Make the World believe, that the</hi> diſſenting <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are</hi> illegally <hi>perſecuted; and ſham off</hi> our late <hi>miſcarriage with pretences, that the</hi> truth of things will come to light; <hi>with boldly demanding</hi> Toleration <hi>and</hi> Liberty <hi>of</hi> Conſcience, <hi>as for</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple no way injurious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Above all, keep up that material diſtinction of <hi>Court and Countrey Party,</hi> ſo as to make the</hi> former <hi>odious to the</hi> people, <hi>and then affrighten them, with</hi> horrible Narratives <hi>and</hi> dreadful
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97029:86"/>
Stories; <hi>and then again ſet them agog with</hi> hopes of Better Times (<hi>if ſuch and ſuch things come to paſs</hi>). <hi>Thus may we deal with the fooliſh and impolitick Rabble of this Nation, as the</hi> Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catcher <hi>did with the Children of</hi> Hamel, <hi>allure them with</hi> Tabor <hi>and</hi> Pipe, <hi>with</hi> empty <hi>ſounds, and</hi> ratling <hi>pretences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at laſt we gingle them to the</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whoſe Womb, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains but a Mouſe, <hi>will become</hi> a Grave big enough to ſwallow them all up.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had done, <hi>Seignior Chriſtiano</hi> went privately to him; <hi>Your ſervant, Sir,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am very glad to ſee you in</hi> England, <hi>I hope all our friends at</hi> Rome <hi>are well.</hi> Very well, (<hi>replyed he</hi>) I ſhould be glad to drink a Glaſs of Wine with you, but that I have extraordinary buſineſs with yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gentleman at preſent: But pray meet me to morrow about three of the Clock at the—<hi>With all my heart,</hi> (replyed <hi>Seignior Chriſtiano</hi>) and then took his leave of him: Turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to me, <hi>That Jeſuit</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd me very civilly at</hi> Rome; <hi>but I don't like his company in</hi> London.

            <p>That thoſe Sir, (<hi>ſaid I</hi>) who <hi>receive moneys</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> Agents, ſhould exclaim againſt <hi>French Penſioners;</hi> that a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> ſhould cry down <hi>Popery,</hi> is no more news, than that an <hi>old Bawd</hi> ſhould inveigh againſt <hi>Fornication;</hi> that a <hi>Libertine</hi> ſhould ſtruggle for <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi> may be, becauſe in the height of his <hi>Politicks</hi> he may fancy, that the letting looſe the <hi>Lyons</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> or three or four thouſand <hi>Bears,</hi> would moſt properly conduce to the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>Subject.</hi> But I wonder, that the people of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be cajol'd into Fears, Diſcontents, and Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by ſuch an unreaſonable and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous diſtinction, as of the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> Party: For have the <hi>Courtiers</hi> no Eſtates?

up to the knees in <hi>Puppy</hi> in their <hi>own</hi> Grounds all the dayes of their lives? I do not ſpeak this to reproach any <hi>Countrey Gentleman:</hi> No Nation in the World has <hi>more</hi> or <hi>better</hi> qualified for all Honourable employments, than this of <hi>England</hi> has in <hi>every County;</hi> but I ſpeak it againſt <hi>thoſe,</hi> who object againſt any Gentleman, though every way well qualified, <hi>only becauſe</hi> (forſooth) <hi>he is a Courtier;</hi> as if a man could not be a <hi>Good Subject</hi> and a <hi>Good Patriot</hi> at the ſame time, and in the ſame place. Why any body ſhould fear, that they ſhould be inſtrumental to the Bringing in of <hi>Popery,</hi> I cannot tell: But I am ſure, a man may obſerve <hi>more</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Dukes Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,</hi> than in any other <hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Chappels</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> But of <hi>all</hi> the men living, <hi>they</hi> have the moſt reaſon to be againſt <hi>Tyranny.</hi> (if there was the leaſt reaſon to fear it): For, ſearch the Hiſtories of all Ages, and you will find, that under <hi>Tyrants, none</hi> of the Subjects were more in danger, than <hi>thoſe</hi> who immediately attended upon their perſons: What a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were the very <hi>Cronies</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Nero, Domitian, &amp;c.</hi> in?

               <hi>Well! for my part</hi> (ſaid <hi>Seignior Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiano) I ſhould not like well to ſee three or four hundred</hi> Suns <hi>ſhining in</hi> England <hi>at once; it is a good</hi> Temperate <hi>Climate</hi> now, <hi>but</hi> then <hi>it would be</hi> too hot for me. <hi>For I muſt tell you, that it is much better for</hi> England, <hi>that the</hi> Sovereignty <hi>ſhould be in <hi>One</hi> woman than in <hi>five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> Men. And I wonder, that the</hi> Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, <hi>who call the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>the</hi> Queen <hi>of</hi> Heaven, <hi>and adore her more than our</hi> Saviour <hi>himſelf,</hi> who is the King of Glory, <hi>ſhould not pay the</hi> Homage of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Honour <hi>to</hi> that <hi>Sex on Earth, to which they pay</hi> Divine Worſhip <hi>in Heaven.

            <p>Truly, Sir, (<hi>ſaid I</hi>) I think here comes one of theſe <hi>antient</hi> ſort of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you talk of. For we now overtook a Comical old Fellow, in ſuch a Garb as I never before had ſeen; he had a great Ruff-band on, which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no imbroidery, for it was made up of old <hi>Saxon</hi> Manuſcripts; and the Trimming to his Cloaths, was old Parchment taſſels, tagg'd with Wax, upon which was the Impreſſion of King <hi>Arthurs Tooth,</hi> and of the <hi>Fangs</hi> of <hi>all his Knights.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We needed not to ſeek long for an opportunity, for he immediately came up to us, ſaying, <hi>Gentlemen, my Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this World, is to vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our</hi> Engliſh Parliaments, <hi>from</hi>

            <p>We did certainly expect, that the <hi>Antiquarian</hi> would have blead him alive, to have made <hi>new Vellum</hi> of his skin, for the affronts he put upon his <hi>old Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But what was extraordinary ſtrange, we could not diſcover, that he was in the leaſt angry with him, at which we much wondred; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I examined thoſe <hi>Parchments,</hi> and found them to be the ſame which Mr. <hi>Petyt</hi> of the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> had made uſe of, for <hi>Aſſerting the Ancient Rights of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>Printed in the Year, Eighty.</hi> And therefore (<hi>ſaid I</hi> to <hi>Seigntor Chriſtiano</hi>) the writing that Book at a <hi>Time,</hi> when the juſt Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Parliament were not in the <hi>leaſt</hi> call'd in Queſtion; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when not only the Kings <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but his <hi>life</hi> alſo was in Danger by a Conſpiracy, formed among ſeveral that <hi>were Members</hi> of <hi>that</hi> Houſe, was juſt as if one ſhould have written of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the <hi>Grants</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings, to ſeveral <hi>Popes,</hi> at <hi>that very</hi> Time, when the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi> Plot was firſt diſcovered.</p>

            <p>At this, both the <hi>Antiquarian,</hi> and <hi>He</hi> that kickt about his <hi>Parchments,</hi> join'd together, and came up to us with a great deal of Fury; and had not I by chance catcht hold of his venerable Ruff, and threatned to demoliſh that reverend relick, we had not parted without a fray; but he thus receiving ſome damage at the firſt onſet, they compounded the matter, and ſo we parted pretty quietly.</p>

raſh and inconſiderate humour) do it with an</hi> ill <hi>deſign to make the King ſuſpected by his People; and ſo at laſt,</hi> would have no King; <hi>and they who give to Parliaments</hi> that power <hi>that does</hi> not <hi>belong to them, give them power to</hi> deſtroy <hi>themſelves, and ſo</hi> would have no Parliaments: <hi>a true notion of a</hi> Commonwealth, <hi>deſtroys the very</hi> being <hi>both of</hi> King, <hi>and</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>for he that diminiſheth, or taketh away the</hi> Prerogative <hi>of the</hi> King, <hi>takes away the very</hi> Power <hi>of</hi> Parliament, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> when He pretends to give them the Kings Prerogative. <hi>So they that fought for</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Parliament, <hi>in the late Wars, fought againſt them</hi> both, <hi>as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the concluſion, and</hi> England <hi>can never be a</hi> Commonwealth <hi>again, until their be</hi> no King, <hi>and then there will <hi>ipſo facto, be no Parliament.</hi>

               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:97029:128"/>
I do not know.
